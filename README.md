// Hi, I’m @mjteegarden
//  I’m interested in learning advanced Python (currently I'm early intermediate) and IDE use (currently I'm starting VSC).  I am working on being employable as a Backend Developer. 
//  I’m currently learning intermediate Python, beginner Kotlin / Javascript and GoLang, the IDE VSC, and Git and GitHub.
//  I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing yet.  I'd be interested in any intern experiences, or other project opportunities.
//  How to reach me: I can be reached at my professional email address, steamread@gmail.com.
//  Pronouns: He/him/his
//  Fun fact: I have experience with LARPing (live action roleplaying) and TTRPG (tabletop roleplaying).
